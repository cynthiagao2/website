                    <h2>Hi, nice to meet you!</h2>

                    <p>I'm an early career professional aspiring to work in <strong>Product Management</strong> or <strong>Front-End Development</strong>.
                    I graduated in 2024 from UC San Diego with a Bachelors' Degree in Computer Science, picking up a Business minor and a Philosophy minor 
                    along the way. During university, I studied <strong>software engineering</strong> (including algorithms, data structures, the Agile 
                    workflow, cybersecurity and cryptography, user design, and processor optimization), <strong>product marketing and management</strong>, 
                    and the <strong>ethical debates happening within technology, business leadership, and the environment</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In the same way that this website is self-taught and self-made, I'm slowly practicing digital art and model rigging so that
                    I can one day debut as a VTuber on Twitch. In my time off, I take pride in being a great mom to my cat (Nico), singing in 
                    the shower, and helping both friends and internet strangers with their Genshin Impact builds!</p>
                    <p>I'm looking forward to working together â™¡</p>
