            <h2>Hi! My name is Cynthia</h2>
            <p>and I aspire to work in <strong>Product Management</strong> or <strong>Front-End Development</strong>. I graduated in 2024 from UC San Diego with 
                a Bachelors' Degree in Computer Science, picking up minors in Business and in Philosophy along the way. During university, 
                I studied <strong>software engineering</strong> (including algorithms, data structures, the Agile workflow, cybersecurity 
                and cryptography, user design, and processor optimization), <strong>product marketing and management</strong>, and 
                the <strong>ethical debates happening within technology, business leadership, and the environment</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the same way that this website is self-taught and self-made, I'm slowly practicing digital art and model rigging so that
                I can one day debut as a VTuber on Twitch. In my time off, I take pride in being a great mom to my cat (Nico), singing in 
                the shower, and helping both friends and internet strangers with their Genshin Impact builds!</p>
            <p>I'm looking forward to working together â™¡</p>
